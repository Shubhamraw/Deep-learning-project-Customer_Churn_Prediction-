Building Artificial Neural Network  with TensorFlow-2.0

Data set customer churn modeling.csv in which a bank has given a fictional data based on these features we need to identify whether the customer is going to stay with the bank or to close the account and leaves the bank

Customer_Churn_Modelling - A model to check wheather the customer ceases his or her relationship with a company or not. 

*** Following steps are taken for building the project
        1. Importing libraries(tensorflow.keras,numpy,pandas,sklearn)
        2. Reading the csv file and cleaning the data 
        3. Splitting the data into train and test and standardizing Feature  
        4. Building ANN --> Adding input layer, Random w init and Adding Hidden Layers with activation function
        5. Select Optimizer, Loss, and Performance Metrics and Compiling the model
        6. using model.fit to train the model
        7. Prediction
        8. Evaluate the model
        9. Adjust optimization parameters or model if needed
